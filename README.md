## Why Version Control System? <a name="why"></a>

Suppose you are working on a simple HTML project, suddenly your boss tells you to change the title of the project. Now you have another version, after that someone else comes and tells you to change the title. This keeps happening for a long time. Now in your system, you have several updated HTML files with new titles. This was the traditional way that the developer used to follow back in the day, where one cannot view what were the changes, and who changed them. This was a problem in those days, but with the help of version control systems, you can easily get the above information without having to save billions of different files in your system.

### Version Control Requirements <a name="version"></a>


* Backup and Restore
* Synchronization
* Undo
* Track Changes and Ownership
* Sandboxing 
* Branching

> **Sandboxing** - Place where you can put all your sample code you donâ€™t need to be published, just like prototyping.

### Two Strategies of Version Control Systems <a name = "two"></a>

* Lock - Modify - Unlock Strategy
* Copy - Modify - Merge Strategy

#### Lock - Modify - Unlock Strategy <a name = "lock"></a>

Here, Jyothi (developer 2) can resolve the conflict
* Remove her own changes and leave the last one.
* Take some part of her implementation and then push the latest version to the server.

> Disadvantage if the entire history is saved in the main server, we need to create some backups

> Each developer has a copy of their own repository, and he/she knows what was changed by who and what. If something happens, then we can use an individual repository as backup.



### Git <a name = "git"></a>

One of the popular Version Control Systems. Please read the [docs](https://git-scm.com/doc)
